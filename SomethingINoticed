As much as I prefer to pick one "course" and stick with it to the end, I have found it surprisingly useful to try
different tutorials/courses on the same topic. I see how the instructors do things slightly differently, and those
differences themselves reveal a lot about how it works.

For example, I have been doing the Rob Percival Udemy Web Dev course, which is very good, but I receltly found
FreeCodeCamp and have been going through the Codecademy courses. I didn't really want to do that, feeling like it 
was moving backwards, or just too slow, but I'm very glad I did because the pieces really start to fall into place
and my imagination really took the info and ran, thinking about possibilities.
